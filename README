Measurement Area Control Daemon
===============================

This listens to MP queries and responds with the MA-Controller information.

Building
--------

0. [git only] autoreconf --install
1. mkdir build
2. ../configure [--prefix /path/to/prefix]
3. make && make install

By default it uses the iniparser library to read configuration files, but it can
be disabled with `--without-iniparser'. It also supports extended statistics
with rrdtool but can be disabled using `--without-rrdtool`. If you only intend
to only build either MArCd or MArelayD use the flags `--disable-daemon` and
`--disable-relay`.

Mysql support is required when building control daemon, i.e. libmysqlclient-dev in Ubuntu packages. 

See `configure --help` for more help.

Install and setup
-----------------

1. Create a user/group to run MArCd, by default marc/marc is used.
2. Put the group in the webgui config as well.
3. Create a directory DATADIR where it will store its rrd files, ie. /var/lib/marcd.
4. Make DATADIR writable by this group.

5. Edit $sysconf/marcd.conf (see $sysconf/marcd.conf.dist)
   If on a ubuntu/debian system copy the files in scripts folder to /etc
      cp scripts/* /etc/ 
   Edit /etc/defaults/marcd, /etc/marcd/marcd.conf and /etc/init.d/marcd if needed.

6. See `MArCd --help` and MArCd(1) for more help.





Measurement Area Relay
======================

The relay is used by MPs to find a MArCd in the local subnet without explicit
configuration, by broadcasting a UDP packet and receiving information where
the control daemon is located.

It can either be run standalone with MArelayD or integrated in MArCd. The former
is useful to have multiple subnets with a single MArCd and the later is useful
if there is only one subnet.





HINTS 
=====

Allways run configure --with-iniparser=bundle (perhaps make it default).
When running configure and PKG_PROG_PKG_CONFIG: command not found, make sure that you have the latest pkg-config installed, then re-run config.
